# ud_fullstack_p1

Repo for my first project on udacity fullstack nanodegree

I've made whole site. You should check only about me section.

To run project:
1. Go to "python" folder.
2. Execute python entertainment_center.py. It will replace placeholders in index.html file with necessary js scripts and info about my favorite movies.
3. Scroll or navigate to "about me" section.
4. Now you should see movies.
